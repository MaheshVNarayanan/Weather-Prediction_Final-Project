# Weather-Prediction_Final-Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict weather conditions based on historical meteorological data using machine learning techniques. The model leverages various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure to forecast future weather conditions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Model deployment (if applicable)

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical weather data, including:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Pressure
- Precipitation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Models used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector model
- Decision Tree classifier
- K Neighbors Classifier
