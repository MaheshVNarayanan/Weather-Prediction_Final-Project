# Weather-Prediction_Final-Project
Weather Prediction using ML
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the weather condition based on historical weather patterns. 
This involves exploring relationships between different weather features, handling missing data, feature engineering, and applying classification algorithms to predict the weather summary for future timestamps. 
The insights derived from this model can be valuable for meteorological forecasting, agriculture, disaster management, and other weather-dependent industries
